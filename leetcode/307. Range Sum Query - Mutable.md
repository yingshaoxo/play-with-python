```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        #2023/01/20 04:58
        self.list = nums
        #2023/01/20 04:59

    def update(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        self.list[index] = val

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return sum(self.list[left: right+1])
```
