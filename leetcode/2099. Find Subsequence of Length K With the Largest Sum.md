Success (the testcase is wrong


```python
import math
class Solution:
    def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        biggest = -math.inf
        a_list = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if i + k != len(nums):
                sub_list = nums[i+1:i+k+1]
                sum_ = sum(sub_list)
                if sum_ > biggest:
                    biggest = sum_
                    a_list = sub_list
